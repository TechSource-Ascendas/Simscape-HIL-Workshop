<Info description="This hands-on workshop introduces participants to Simscape, MATLAB and Simulink’s physical modeling environment for simulating multi-domain systems. Through guided exercises, attendees will learn how to build plant models using Simscape libraries, parameterize components using empirical or manufacturer data, and run simulations to analyze system behavior.&#10;&#10;Participants will learn how to quickly build plant models, run multi-domain simulations, and validate controllers using real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing with Speedgoat target hardware."/>
