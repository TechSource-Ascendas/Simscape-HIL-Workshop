# Modeling and Hardware\-in\-the\-Loop (HIL) Testing of Physical Systems using Simscape
<!-- Begin Toc -->

## Workshop Overview
This hands-on workshop introduces participants to Simscape, MATLAB and Simulink’s physical modeling environment for simulating multi-domain systems. Through guided exercises, attendees will learn how to build plant models using Simscape libraries, parameterize components using empirical or manufacturer data, and run simulations to analyze system behavior.

Participants will learn how to quickly build plant models, run multi-domain simulations, and validate controllers using real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing with Speedgoat target hardware.

## Learning Outcome
By the end of the session, participants will be able to:
  1. Understand the fundamentals of physical modeling in Simscape.
  2. Build a mechanical or electrical plant model using standard Simscape libraries.
  3. Apply parameterization techniques, including using real component data.
  4. Perform time-domain simulation and analyze system responses.
  5. Use Simscape Results Explorer for visualization and debugging.
  6. Integrate a plant model with basic control logic in Simulink.
